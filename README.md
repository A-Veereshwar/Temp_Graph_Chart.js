# Plotting Global Temperature Data from NASA
I have took the CSV file data from the officail website of NASA where it shows the change in trends in the global average temperatures from the year 1880 - 2023.  

I have done this by using a javaScript library called **Chart.js**, where we can plot different types of Graphs such as bar graphs, line graphs and Area charts etc.  

Visualizing this data shows us how the global average temperature is raising year on year, which raises concern to overall humanity.
